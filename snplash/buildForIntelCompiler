# Create the environment and directory structure to compile SNPLASH
# with the Intel compiler suite.  This script is written to use the
# 'modules' system (http://modules.sourceforge.net) for setting
# environment variables.  You probably will have to edit this file and
# the Intel compiler information in CMakeLists.txt to adapt to your
# system.

mkdir build
cd build

module load openmpi/1.6-intel

# The 'module load' command sets the compiler environment variable $MPICC.  Absent
# the modules system, set the Intel compiler as in one of the examples below.

# Intel compiler command:
# ICPC=`which icpc`
# MPICC=`which mpicc`

# And adjust the compiler command in the following if necessary.
cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$MPICC -D ICPC=TRUE ..

echo "Now cd into ./build and type \'make\'. The executable will be in this directory."
