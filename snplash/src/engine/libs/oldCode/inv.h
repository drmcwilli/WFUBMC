/*************************************************************************
Inversion of a matrix given by its LU decomposition.

Input parameters:
    A       -   LU decomposition of the matrix (output of RMatrixLU subroutine).
    Pivots  -   table of permutations which were made during the LU decomposition
                (the output of RMatrixLU subroutine).
    N       -   size of matrix A.

Output parameters:
    A       -   inverse of matrix A.
                Array whose indexes range within [0..N-1, 0..N-1].

Result:
    True, if the matrix is not singular.
    False, if the matrix is singular.
